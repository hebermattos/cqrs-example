## CQRS

### What's it?

The CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern is an architectural approach that separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands) within a system. This allows optimizing each type of operation according to its specific needs. For instance, read operations can be optimized for fast and efficient queries, while write operations may prioritize data consistency and validation. This clear separation can lead to more scalable and flexible systems, although it may add some complexity to the design and implementation.

### Two Databases?

Utilizing two databases in the CQRS pattern involves dedicating one database to handle commands and another for queries. This optimization allows each database to be tailored for its specific task, enhancing performance and scalability. The command database focuses on data consistency and validation, while the query database prioritizes fast read access, often employing denormalized structures or caching. This separation enables the system to efficiently handle varying workloads and scale independently. However, ensuring data consistency between the two databases becomes a critical consideration in the design.
